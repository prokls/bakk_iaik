Simple evaluation obviously has the worst performance. Destroying and building the SAT solver takes a lot of time and slows down the automated search. The advantage of this approach comes into play, when the evaluated differential characteristic is very large. However this size is not within the scope for SAT-based attacks of hash algorithms.

The approaches for Activation literals, Reduced encoding and Differential state encoding all seem interesting and perform very good. Further study is advised to improve the speed by studying the recurring structures due to assigned bit conditions.

\section{Propagation}
%
The propagation in the automated search improved previous implementation, because overlapping bits are detected and considered. Therefore the implementation scales better for larger sizes, because invalid paths are eliminated faster. Figure~\ref{fig:sat-propagation} can directly be compared to the propagation diagrams given in~\cite{Cry16}.

\section{Implementation-dependent improvements}
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tests shall be made also with different state-of-the-art SAT solvers from different families of the DPLL algorithm such that comparison is possible.
  \item An implementation of the activation literal approach is desirable.
  \item The truth table is a bottleneck of the Initialization step. Tests are required whether approaches like Tseitin's Definitional Normal Form perform better as discussed in~\cite{Sat03}.
  \item SAT solvers themselves propagate values in their evaluation. The same concept is desirable in \nltool. Strategies to put SAT solver technology directly into the framework shall be discussed.
  \item Any fast simplification algorithms for boolean equations are of interest. In the initialization step all clauses are already known. Performing a simplification algorithm especially to the clauses of the primitive functions might lead to a speedup. Karnaugh maps, the Quine-McCluskey algorithm and the Espresso algorithm shall be considered. Simplification algorithms have been implemented by Akawat Homsirikamol et~al.~\cite{Cry04} with HDL in the Quartus II software.
\end{itemize}

\section{Independent approaches}
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item SMT solvers and STP allow a more powerful encoding of the problem to solve. This deprecates the usage of truth tables and encodings. A comparison is of interest.
\end{itemize}
